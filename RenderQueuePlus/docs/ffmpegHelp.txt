When 'ffmpeg.exe' is set and the 'Create QuickTime' box ticked,
RenderQueue+ will create a QuickTime automatically from the rendered images sequence.

You can customise the render quality of the resulting mp4 by changing the -crf value.

The default switches are:
-vcodec libx264 -crf 12 -pix_fmt yuv420p

('mp4' is hard-coded as the container.)
